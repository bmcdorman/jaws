====

Lightweight and transparent JAva WebSockets.

jaws hopes to provide a fast, robust, and compliant WebSocket implementation in Java. The end goal for
jaws is to transparently support WebSocket clients in an unmodified (and possibly closed source) TCP server. That
said, jaws should also support other use cases.

jaws does not require any sort of external web server or servlet API. jaws can also run non-threaded or threaded, allowing
you to choose the architecture that suites your application best.

Building and Installing 
------------------------

jaws is built using maven. Use your system's package manager to install maven if you don't have it already.

Once you have maven installed and the jaws repository cloned, run:

    cd jaws
    mvn clean install
    
That's it! Maven will download the required dependencies, build the project, run unit tests, and install it to your system
for use by other projects.

Usage
-----

Coming soon!

Speed and Benchmarks
--------------------

Preliminary testing shows that unoptimized jaws is just as fast as node.js websockets. This section will have pretty
graphs and more information soon.
