Lightweight and transparent JAva WebSockets.

Jaws hopes to provide a fast, robust, and compliant WebSocket implementation in Java. The end goal for
jaws is to transparently support WebSocket clients in an unmodified (and possibly closed source) TCP server. That
said, jaws should also support other use cases.

Current implementations of WebSockets in Java such as Jetty provide high-level abstractions at the cost of flexibility.
Jaws is designed to be as abstract or as close to the metal as the developer wishes.
